## Road-map

Some changes have been planned, like:
 - Analyzing all audio streams, better MXF audio tracks and audio track management.
 - Better reports, (as PDF?) with embedded graphics.
 - Manage variable frame rate statistics (actually done, but need to be deeply checked to ensure the measure method is correct).
 - Work on live streams, instead of just regular files.
 - FFmpeg and FFprobe parallel executions.

And [many others](https://github.com/mediaexmachina/mediadeepa/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aenhancement), I hope !
