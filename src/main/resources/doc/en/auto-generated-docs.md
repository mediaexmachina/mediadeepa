## Auto-generated documentation

### Bash-completion

The application provide a dynamic bash-completion script generated by:

```bash
java -jar target/mediadeepa-<version>.jar --autocomplete
```

### Man page

An auto-generated **man** page can be produced by an internal option:

```bash
java -Dexportdocumentation.manpage="/full/path/to/file.man" -jar target/mediadeepa-<version>.jar
```

### README page

Auto-generated by Mediadeepa, like the man page, and can be produced by the internal option:

```bash
java -Dexportdocumentation.readme="README.md" -jar target/mediadeepa-<version>.jar
```

All source text for documentation is either auto-generated by the internal application options and static markdown files in the `src/main/resources/doc/en` directory.

### Project web page

Auto-generated by Mediadeepa, like the man and README pages, and can be produced by the internal option:

```bash
java -Dexportdocumentation.website="docs/index.html" -jar target/mediadeepa-<version>.jar
```

Same method to generate this file, like README/man files does.
