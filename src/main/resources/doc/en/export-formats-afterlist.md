You can use several exports formats, comma separated, like `-f txt -f xml -f json`.

_NB: exports formats like XML or JSON can produce very large files, which may take time to make, if want to use all filters/analysis scopes (up to 4 MB for a file less than 1 minute of media). It's not a problem for Mediadeepa, but it can be for you!_
