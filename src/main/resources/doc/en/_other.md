### ðŸŽ¨ Options

Refer to the integrated command line help to get the full list.

Refer to [FFmpeg documentation](https://www.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html) to have more details on the works of each filter, and on the expected values.

No option are mandatory ; all will be empty and let to the default values to FFmpeg.

### ðŸ—œ Limit the scope of analysis

By default, all analysis options and filters are activated in relation to your FFmpeg setup. Container analysis is still optional (via `-c`).

Not all options are necessarily useful for everyone and all the time (like [crop detect](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#cropdetect)), the processing of certain filters can be very resource intensive (like [SITI](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#siti-1)), and/or produce a large amount of data.

First, you can list all active filters with the `-o` option:

```
Detected (and usable) filters:
amerge         Merge two or more audio streams into a single multi-channel stream.
ametadata      Manipulate audio frame metadata.
aphasemeter    Convert input audio to phase meter video output.
astats         Show time domain statistics about audio frames.
channelmap     Remap audio channels.
channelsplit   Split audio into per-channel streams.
ebur128        EBU R128 scanner.
join           Join multiple audio streams into multi-channel output.
silencedetect  Detect silence.
volumedetect   Detect audio volume.
blackdetect    Detect video intervals that are (almost) black.
blockdetect    Blockdetect filter.
blurdetect     Blurdetect filter.
cropdetect     Auto-detect crop size.
freezedetect   Detects frozen video input.
idet           Interlace detect Filter.
mestimate      Generate motion vectors.
metadata       Manipulate video frame metadata.
siti           Calculate spatial information (SI) and temporal information (TI).
```

> The description of each filter comes from the return of FFmpeg command.

And you can choose the analysis processing with these options:

```bash
-c, --container            Do a container analysing (ffprobe streams)
[...]
-fo, --filter-only FILTER  Allow only this filter(s) to process (-o to get list)
-fn, --filter-no FILTER    Not use this filter(s) to process (-o to get list)
-mn, --media-no            Disable media analysing (ffmpeg)
-an, --audio-no            Ignore all video filters
-vn, --video-no            Ignore all audio filters
```

#### ðŸ“¦ Export formats

With the integrated help, you can get the export features currently available, to use with `-f`.

```
[...]
Export formats available:
txt            Values separated by tabs in text files
csv            Classic CSV files
csvfr          French flavor CSV files
xlsx           XLSX Spreadsheet
sqlite         SQLite database
xml            XML Document
json           JSON Document
html           HTML report document
ffprobexml     Media file headers on FFprobe XML
[...]
```

You can use several exports formats, comma separated, like `-f txt,xml,json`.

_NB: exports formats like XML or JSON can produce very large files, which may take time to make, if want to use all filters/analysis scopes (up to 4 MB for a file less than 1 minute of media). It's not a problem for Mediadeepa, but it can be for you!_

The `-e` parameter set the target export directory to put the produced files.

The `--export-base-filename` set a _base name_, used like `BASENAME-export-format-internal-name.extension`.

### Bash-completion

The application provide a dynamic bash-completion script generated by:

```bash
java -jar target/mediadeepa-<VERSION>.jar --autocomplete
```

### Man page

An auto-generated **man** page can be produced by an internal option:

```bash
java -Dexportdocumentation.manpage="/full/path/to/file.man" -jar target/mediadeepa-<VERSION>.jar
```

### README page

Auto-generated by Mediadeepa, like the man page, and can be produced by the internal option:

```bash
java -Dexportdocumentation.readme="README.md" -jar target/mediadeepa-<VERSION>.jar
```

All source text for documentation is either auto-generated by the internal application options and static markdown files in the `src/main/resources/doc/en` directory.

## ðŸŽˆ Road-map

Some changes have been planned, like:
 - Analyzing all audio streams, better MXF audio tracks and audio track management.
 - Better reports, (as PDF?) with embedded graphics.
 - Manage variable frame rate statistics (actually done, but need to be deeply checked to ensure the measure method is correct).
 - Work on live streams, instead of just regular files.
 - FFmpeg and FFprobe parallel executions.

And [many others](https://github.com/mediaexmachina/mediadeepa/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aenhancement), I hope !
