## Releases

On each `git tag`, a GitHub *Action* will make a DEB and a RPM package on [GitHub releases](https://github.com/mediaexmachina/mediadeepa/releases).

This Action use [linux-springboot-packager](https://github.com/hdsdi3g/linux-springboot-packager) to generate this files. Free feel to read this project documentation.

These packages are provided "as-it", as same for Mediadeepa. They are not signed.
