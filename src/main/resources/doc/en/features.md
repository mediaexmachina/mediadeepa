Mediadeepa can handle any audio/video files managed by FFmpeg, and produce reports with it.

Analysis scope is currently based on FFmpeg filters and tools:
   - Audio phase meter `aphasemeter`
   - Time domain statistics about audio frames `astats`
   - Audio loudness meter (EBU R128 scanner) `ebur128`
   - Audio silence detection `silencedetect`
   - Video black/block artifacts/blurred/duplicate/interlacing frames detection (`blackdetect` / `blockdetect` / `blurdetect` / `freezedetect` / `idet`)
   - Video border detection `cropdetect`
   - Video spatial information (SI) and temporal information (TI) `siti`
   - Structural media container information: audio/video stream frames size, timing, GOP type
   - Export a FFprobe XML file based on media file headers
   - Create a technical resumed of media file based on FFprobe media file header
   - Optional filter use, based on command line (user choice) and current FFmpeg filter availability on app environment.
   - User can optionally add timed constraints:
     - start position on media file
     - limit analysis duration on media file
     - limit time to do the analysis operation
   - During the analyzing operation, an ETA/progress bar is displayed, and based on current FFmpeg processing

Export analysis format produce:
   - Plain text files (txt files, tabular separated)
   - CSV files
     - Classical: comma separated, "`.`" decimal separator.
     - French flavor: semicolon separated, "`,`" decimal separator.
   - Excel / XLSX Spreadsheet (simple raw data export, one tabs by export result)
   - SQLite
   - XML
   - JSON
   - Values displayed in charts:
     - Audio Loudness (integrated, short-term, momentary, true-peak), by time
     - Audio phase correlation (+/- 180Â°), by time
     - Audio DC offset, signal entropy, flatness, noise floor, peak level, silence/mono events, by time
     - Video quality as spatial information (SI) and temporal information
     - Video block/blur/black/interlacing/crop/freeze detection, by time
     - Video and audio iterate frames, by frame
     - Video frame duration stability, by frame
     - Video GOP (group of picture) size (number of frames by GOP, and by frame type), by GOP index.
     - Video GOP frame size, by frame type, by GOP, by frame number.
   - Useful HTML report with file and signal stats, event detection, codecs, GOP stats...

And it can export to file the FFprobe XML with media headers (container and A/V streams).

This application can run on three different modes:
 - **Process to export**: this is the classical mode. Mediadeepa will drive FFmpeg to produce analysis data from your source file, and export the result a the end.
 - **Process to extract**: sometimes, you don't need to process data during the analysis session. So, Mediadeepa can just extract to raw text/xml files (zipped in one archive file) all the gathered data from FFmpeg.
 - **Import to export**: to load in Mediadeepa all gathered raw data files. Mediadeepa is **very tolerant** with the zip content, notably if they were not created by Mediadeepa (originally). **No one is mandatory in zip.**

Known limitations for Mediadeepa:

 - It only support the first video, and the first founded audio stream of a file.
 - Audio mono and stereo only.
 - Some process take (long) time to do, like SITI and container analyzing, caused by poor FFmpeg/FFprobe performances with **this** filters.
