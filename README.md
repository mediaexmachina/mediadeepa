# Media Deep Analysis

Audio/video medias and streams deep analyzer in Java with FFmpeg as back-end: extract/process technical information from audio/videos files/streams.

**This application is currently in alpha version, and should not be ready for production**

## üö© About

This application will run FFmpeg on a source video/audio file to apply some filters, and generate analysis raw data (mostly high verbosely text/XML streams). They are parsed and reduced/converted/summarized them to some output formats by Mediadeepa.

> Mediadeepa is a command line standalone application (no GUI, no specific setup).

## üè™ Features    

Mediadeepa can handle any audio/video files managed by FFmpeg, and produce reports with it.

Analysis scope is currently based on FFmpeg filters and tools:
   - Audio phase meter `aphasemeter`
   - Time domain statistics about audio frames `astats`
   - Audio loudness meter (EBU R128 scanner) `ebur128`
   - Audio silence detection `silencedetect`
   - Video black/block artifacts/blurred/duplicate/interlacing frames detection (`blackdetect` / `blockdetect` / `blurdetect` / `freezedetect` / `idet`)
   - Video border detection `cropdetect`
   - Video spatial information (SI) and temporal information (TI) `siti`
   - Structural media container information: audio/video stream frames size, timing, GOP type
   - Export a FFprobe XML file based on media file headers
   - Create a technical resumed of media file based on FFprobe media file header
   - Optional filter use, based on command line (user choice) and current FFmpeg filter availability on app environment.
   - User can optionally add timed constraints:
     - start position on media file
     - limit analysis duration on media file
     - limit time to do the analysis operation
   - During the analyzing operation, an ETA/progress bar is displayed, and based on current FFmpeg processing

Export analysis format produce:
   - Plain text files (txt files, tabular separated)

## ‚ö° Getting started

### üî© Dependencies needed for run Mediadeepa

  - Java/JRE/JDK 17+
  - FFmpeg/FFprobe v5+

Declared on OS (Windows/Linux/macOS) PATH.

Make the application jar file (autonomous *fat* jar) via Maven with

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mediaexmachina/mediadeepa.git
cd mediadeepa
mvn install -DskipTests
```

Build jar will found on `target` directory like `mediadeepa-<version>.jar`

And run the application simple with

```bash
java -jar mediadeepa-<version>.jar
```

Mediadeepa contain embedded help, displayed by default, or with `-h` parameter.

## üõ´ Usage

This application can run on three different modes:
 - [Process to export](#üåø-process-to-export)
 - [Process to extract](#üåø-process-to-extract)
 - [Import to export](#üåø-import-to-export)

### üåø Process to export

This is the classical mode.

Mediadeepa will drive FFmpeg to produce analysis data from your source file, and export the result a the end (actually, only in text files).

Use these options with this mode:

```
-i, --input FILE           Input (media) file to process
-c, --container            Do a container analysing (FFprobe streams)
-f, --format FORMAT_TYPE   Format to export datas
-e, --export DIRECTORY     Export datas to this directory
```

### üåø Process to extract

Sometimes, you don't need to process data during the analysis session.

So, Mediadeepa can just extract to raw text files all the gathered data from FFmpeg.

Use these options with this mode:

```
--extract-alavfi TEXT_FILE        Extract raw FFmpeg datas from LAVFI audio metadata filter
--extract-vlavfi TEXT_FILE        Extract raw FFmpeg datas from LAVFI video metadata filter
--extract-stderr TEXT_FILE        Extract raw FFmpeg datas from stderr
--extract-probeheaders XML_FILE   Extract XML FFprobe datas from container headers
--extract-probesummary TEXT_FILE  Extract simple FFprobe data summary from container headers
--extract-container XML_FILE      Extract XML FFprobe datas from container analyser
```

### üåø Import to export

And now, how do you get process analyst with this raw files ?

With the third mode: import, to load in Mediadeepa all gathered raw data files. Mediadeepa is **very tolerant** with this files, notably if they were not created by Mediadeepa (originally). **No one is mandatory.**

Use these options with this mode:

```
--import-lavfi TEXT_FILE        Import raw FFmpeg datas from LAVFI metadata filter
--import-stderr TEXT_FILE       Import raw FFmpeg datas from stderr filter
--import-probeheaders XML_FILE  Import XML FFprobe datas from container headers
--import-container XML_FILE     Import raw FFprobe datas from container analyser
-f, --format FORMAT_TYPE        Format to export datas
-e, --export DIRECTORY          Export datas to this directory
```

## üìï Documentation

You can found some documentation:
 - here, on the project's READ-ME
 - via the Mediadeepa command line interface

This document was check by Aspell with:

```bash
aspell check --lang=en_US --dont-backup --mode=markdown README.md
```

## üéà Road-map

Some changes have been planned, like:
 - Analyzing all audio streams, better MXF/single audio track management
 - Set manual parameters, like silence detection level floor
 - Manage variable frame rate statistics
 - Export data values to other formats:
   - CSV (generic, and french)
   - XLSX
   - Open Document spread sheet
   - XML
   - JSON
   - SQLite
   - ...
 - Produce numeric data in PNG/JPG graphics
   - Loudness
   - Audio stats
   - Bit-rate / Frame sizes
   - GOP Width / GOP size
   - Frame duration
   - Packet sizes
   - Media event (freeze, black, silence...)
   - Audio complexity / video complexity
   - ...
 - Work on live streams, instead of just regular files.
 - Create useful reports
   - HTML
   - PDF
   - DOCX
   - Open-Document text
